# PreFlight

Python programs for rocket flight telemetry emulation.
- altitude calculations
- fuel calculations
- flight trajectories optimization
- speed, dynamic pressure, acceleration, drag & other cool math !

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python3.x for running the `.py` files.

To install the required python modules just run the following command in the command line.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installing

 1. Cloning
    Through the command line, get to the directory you wish to clone the repository into then run the following command.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Oxyde2/Preflight.git
    ```

2. Downloading the ZIP
    Download the compressed files and unzip them.

Once you have successfully obtained your local copy open the project folder in your desired IDE or text editor.

Great! You're all set now!

### Launch the program!

1. Running the `.exe` file

    - Navigate through the command-line:
      ```bash
      cd dist/PreFlight
      ./PreFlight.exe
      ```
    - Or find the file through the file explorer.

2. Running the `.py` file

    **You need to have Python3.x installed and have it's paths in the PATH environmental variable**

    - Navigate from the PreFlight folder:
      ```bash
      cd dist/PreFlight
      python PreFlight.py
      ```
    - Or find the file through the file explorer.
