# PreFlight

Python programs for rocket flight telemetry emulation.
- altitude calculations
- fuel calculations
- flight trajectories optimization
- speed, dynamic pressure, acceleration, drag & other cool math !

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

[Optional] Python3.x for running the .py files.

### Installing

Follow the steps below to get the development environment running.

1. Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone git@git.nowtryz.net:IOrbital/preflight.git
    cd preflight/Core
    ```

### Launch the app

1. Running the .exe file

    **[Recommended]** Navigate from the PreFlight folder:
    ```bash
    cd dist/PreFlight
    ./PreFlight.exe
    ```
    Or create a shortcut from the file explorer GUI and ```double click it```.

2. Running the .py file

    **You need to have Python3.x installed and have it's paths in the PATH variable**
    
    Navigate from the PreFlight folder:
    ```bash
    python PreFlight.py
    ```
    Or create a shortcut from the file explorer GUI and ```double click it```.

## Built With
